## The problem

Started of with the excellent exampel project w6 as a base for what I wanted to do.  

I am realy struggeling with external issues like geting eslint to work. Also the process of having a lot of components done before u can accualy view the progress in the browser. I hade some problems with flexbox that I worked around.

If I had more time I would solve the problem with flex,colomn and get it to work. I would also build the components different.
Spent a litle more time for settings to get some stuff sorted automatically and save alot of time.
